# Experiment to evaluate the impact of the training set on results of the algorithm.
# Train N_TRIALS times on each of the different sizes of the training subset, each 
# time choosing a the subset randomly.
# After each training evaluate on a fixed set of test images.
#
# Plot the results on a 2D graph:
#   - X axis shows different sizes of training subsets
#   - Y axis shows SSD error from ground truth for each test image in each trial
#

K = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100] # number of training examples

N_TRIALS = 10

EXPERIMENTING

foreach M in K
  foreach N in N_TRIALS
    choose M random training samples
    train
    foreach I in M
      test I and save result
      calculate error and write to disk


    
PLOTTING

foreach M in K
  foreach I in M
    plot [M, error(I,M)]
